	<p>My current project is to get familiar with git and github. Although it sounds rather a flimsy statement there is a 
		more ambitious goal behind this statement. I would like to develop java programs which incorporate AI (Artificial 
		Intelligence).  I am very much a beginner with AI therefore I searched the internet for suitable AI training packages. 
		I came across one sponsors by Microsoft, “Generative AI for beginners Java”.  This training package uses github. 
		However, once I started looking into the lessons, I realised that I need to get familiar with git and github in 
		order to take full advantage of the training.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have parked the AI training course at the moment in order to get familiar git/github, I decided that I could 
		use my time with git/github to update my knowledge of web development.  I have to use the  internet collect a 
		good comprehension of web design and assembled a static knowledge website to document my use of HTML5, CSS3 and 
		Javascript(ECMAScript 2025).  The website is very much developed for my own use, but because it  is hosted in 
		github pages it is public and available for viewing by the world.
